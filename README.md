# Trip-Advisor-Hotel-Reviews-Classifier
Alam, M. H., Ryu, W.-J., Lee, S., 2016. Joint multi-grain topic sentiment: modeling semantic aspects for online reviews. Information Sciences 339, 206â€“223.

I used a dataset of 20 491 elements. Eventually, I analysed and built a classificator, that will determine the hotel's rating by its review.
Dataset is a table containing 2 columns: ```review``` and ```rating``` in 5-star measure.
